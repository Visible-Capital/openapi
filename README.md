# Sample code for connecting to Visible Capital's Open Api
### Simple example that will show how to add open banking to your application in a few lines of code

This is a very basic example of a proposed implementation of our open API

To get a set of credentials please contact support@visiblecapital.io

## The sample app
- In this sample we are going to get open banking data for a client that is completing our imaginary factfind application. 
- First we log in
- Then we create a client
- Then we create a request for Wealth report (assessment)
- Then we get the url for the wealth report we just created
- Then we redirect the client to the open banking process
- Finally we get the client redirected back to our application and we make a final call to the Visible Capital'a API to get the report in a json format.
